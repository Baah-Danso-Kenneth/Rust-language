/** Reassigning a varable**/
 By default Variables aree immmutable meaning they cant be change
 In order to change them you have to use "mut" attached to the variables to change them:

 
 fun main(){
    let mut x = 20;
    println!("The number of x is :{x}");
    let x=32;
    println!("The number of x is : {x}");
 }

 In this case we have used Mutability which allows us to change x value

/**const**/
 with [const] they are immutable at defining and reaassign a variable 
 Meaning as long as a variable is defined with a const it cannot be changed or reassigned it does not even take [mut]

 The naming conventions of a const must be :   eg:  const THREE_HOUR_SECOND: u32= 60 * 60 * 3;

 capital letters and seperated by a hiphen;

 Shadowing:
 With shadowing a variable is created with a let key word and later we reassigned that same value using the let key word with the same name:
 let x=5;
 let x=x+6;
